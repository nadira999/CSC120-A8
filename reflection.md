- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
This class represents a ninjaTurtle that is exploring a city in order to safe people. 

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
I used overloaded constructor, a a showoptions method that will allow the user to see the available option in the inventory. Something new i used was a tostring method. 


- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I was really frustrated with getting the direction done right and we haven't done any examples of that in the class. Fortunately, I was able to get implement it with the help of Pro.Jordan and TAs.
